# Learning Objectives

To create an awareness of a wide range of bioinformatics tools and sufficient experience to use those tools in basic investigations with a relatively high degree of user independence.

To become aware of specific tools for NGS data analysis (transcriptomis, variant analysis).

To be able to create simple scripts that automate bioinformatics tasks, thus enlarging the scope of action of the tools, applied to large datasets.

<br/>

# Course Pre-requisites

Basic understanding of molecular biology. No particular computing expertise will be assumed.

Recommended Linux and basic Unix command line skills, such as navigating in a directory tree and copy files will be helpful. See, for example, ["Session 1" of the Software Carpentry training for a Unix introduction](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/shell-novice/).
