Course description
This is an entry level course in three parts, aimed at those with a reasonable biological background but no significant experience with 
bioinformatics. 

The course content is designed to show how, by going through guided exercises, how a researcher in the
bio-medical area can access sequence data and steer his analysis to efficiently extract results, checking how credible they are 
and reason about using them confidently, in a reproducible way.

This course will also provide a soft introduction to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. This part of the course 
aims at providing basic skills that are needed when one needs to process NGS data,  using open source bioinformatics tools.

Thirdly, the course will cover the broad theme of analytical automation, and how it enhances the capacity of researchers by
widening the scope of their experiments, comparing results in a large scale and summarising the findings in simple but very 
reproducible ways.

Objectives
- To create an awareness of a wide range of bioinformatics tools and sufficient experience 
to use those tools in basic investigations with a relatively high degree of user independence.
- To become aware of specific tools for NGS data analysis (transcriptomis, variant analysis)
- To be able to create simple scripts that automate bioinformatics tasks, thus enlarging the scope of action of the tools, applied to large datasets.


Target Audience
Researchers at any level, wishing to investigate how they might begin to exploit the ever expanding abundance of computing and data resources.

Course Pre-requisites
Basic understanding of molecular biology. No particular computing expertise will be assumed.
