Course description
This is an entry level course aimed that those with a reasonable biological background but no significant experience with bioinformatics. 

This course will also provide a soft introduction to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. This part of the course aims at providing basic skills that are needed when one needs to process NGS data,  using open source bioinformatics tools.

Objectives
- To create an awareness of a wide range of bioinformatics tools and sufficient experience 
to use those tools in basic investigations with a relatively high degree of user independence.
- To become aware of specific tools for NGS data analysis (transcriptomis, variant analysis)
- To be able to create simple scripts that automate bioinformatics tasks, thus enlarging the scope of action of the tools, applied to large datasets.


Target Audience
Researchers at any level, wishing to investigate how they might begin to exploit the ever expanding abundance of computing and data resources.

Course Pre-requisites
Basic understanding of molecular biology. No particular computing expertise will be assumed.
